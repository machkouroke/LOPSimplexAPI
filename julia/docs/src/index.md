# What is LopShelve
A shelf is an object similar to a dictionary but which allows data persistence. You could thus save your data in a file as if it were a dictionary. This julia implementation is based on the Shelve version of python. So if you used the Shelve version of python you would not be out of place.
However this implementation does not stop there, you could also use LopShelve to map 
your data from database (Sqlite) to dictionary
